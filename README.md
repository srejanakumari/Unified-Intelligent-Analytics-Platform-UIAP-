The Unified Intelligent Analytics Platform (UIAP) is a comprehensive Python-based project that combines multiple analytics domains â€” Data Analytics, Business Analytics, AI/ML Analytics, Web Analytics, and Cybersecurity Analytics â€” into one powerful system.
It demonstrates how modern organizations can unify insights from diverse data sources to make data-driven decisions and detect security threats in real time.

This project is designed to run directly in Jupyter Notebook and includes data simulation, visualizations, predictive modeling, and anomaly detection â€” all in one workflow.
